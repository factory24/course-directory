Partner courses on Factory24 are courses we offer to our students courtesy of our partners. Currently we offer various course from partners like Microsoft, IBM, and other independent educators. These courses are also facilitated by expert trainers who interact one on one with students in the duration of their study. 

We are always accepting new partners to the Factory24 platform and if you have similar courses that we can offer to our students, follow the submission guide hightlighted in our **# How To Submit New Courses** section, and if you experience any challenges or issues with any of the partner courses we offer on the platform follow the **# Issue Submission** guide above. 

For students this certification doesn't just guarantee an internship with a Factory24 partner, it will also increase employability probability once internship is completed under our high quality mentors and high-performance companies. For in-house courses, certifications will cost $49 and for partner courses, the prices will vary course-to-course. 

To apply as a course facilitator we consider `your years of expericence in your field of application`, `how manage hours a week you can commit to the role`, `your facilitation style` and `your overall vision for the course(s) you'll be managing`. We currently work with a wide range of facilitators covering over 5 difference technology stacks. To get started with a role send an email to **factory24@protonmail.com** and you'll be advised on next steps.

## Become A Course Facilitator

Factory24 course facilitators will have several tasks in their role including:

* managing all the various courses they sign-up to facilitate, 
* address student concerns about the course, 
* optimize how we offer current and future courses eg through use case studies, 
* source course projects for internship placements etc. 



## Raise Issues Regarding Specific Courses

As a student or facilitator you will likely run into issues regarding some courses. We welcome all the feedback that will improve how we offer courses, the courses we offer and the potential impact of each course. To provide feedback on any issues that might arise in the duration of your study we suggest several ways to share your feedback. 

* Open a new issue on the repository with the title of the course and a problem or improvement suggestion.
* Contact the course facilitator on [Factory24](https://factory24.org)
* Send an email to **factory24@protonmail.com** with the subject title as course name

Our facilitators will respond to any and all the feedback that will be shared regarding each issue raised. 

## Certification Options

As a facilitator, you have the option to design and offer courses with a certification option once students have completed one or more of your courses. The certification option is used by Factory24 to offer students who have completed each course an internship in a project based on the technology they've studied. These are projects that have been internally sourced and work with Factory24 to offer students an environment to get put to practice lessons they've learned.
