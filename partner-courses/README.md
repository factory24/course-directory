Through our partners like Microsoft, IBM, and other independent educators, we offer our students various partner courses that are facilitated by expert trainers who interact one on one with students in the duration of their study. 

For students a Microsoft or IBM certification doesn't just guarantee an internship with a Factory24 partner, it will also increase employability probability once internship is completed under our high quality mentors and high-performance companies. 

To join the Factory24 as a partner course facilitator we consider `your years of expericence in your field of application`, `how manage hours a week you can commit to the role`, `your facilitation style` and `your overall vision for the course(s) you'll be managing`. We currently work with a wide range of facilitators covering over 5 difference technology stacks. To get started with a role send an email to **factory24@protonmail.com** for a guide on the next steps. 

We welcome all the feedback that will improve how we offer courses, the courses we offer and the potential impact of each course. To provide feedback on any issues that might arise in the duration of your study we suggest several ways to share your feedback. 

* Open a new issue on the repository with the title of the course and a problem or improvement suggestion.
* Contact the course facilitator on [Factory24](https://factory24.org)
* Send an email to **factory24@protonmail.com** with the subject title as course name

Our facilitators will respond to any and all the feedback that will be shared regarding each issue raised.
